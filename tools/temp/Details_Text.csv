bookVeg1,,,book,"When a crop's age counter hits 0, it is ripe and ready to be used in an attack. Some crops - like vegetables - will rot if left on the field after their age counter passes 0. Rotten crops can be removed by being composted to recover health.",
bookVeg2,,,book,"Other crops - like fruits - will regrow over time. If their age counter passes 0 the ripe crops will wither away, but the tree will still produce more crops later.",
bookVeg3,,,book,"Both vegetables and fruits can be planted anywhere on a standard farm field. However, there are other crop types out there, each with their own unique features, so be sure to try them all!",
bookSeasons,,,bname,"""The Story of Seasons"" by Victor Wada \n A primer on how seasons will affect your crops.",
bookSeasons0,,,book,"At the start of every farming battle, a season is chosen depending on the enemies you are fighting. The season will change every 30 turns, or after you or one of your enemies uses a Season Modulator.",
bookSeasons1,,,book,"How powerful your crops are depends on the current season. A crop is either GOOD, OKAY, or BAD in a given season. GOOD crops will do twice as much damage, and BAD crops will do very little damage.",
bookSeasons2,,,book,"Keep the current season in mind when planting new crops. If you're planting a regrowing crop like a tree or mushroom, keep the future seasons in mind, too. Planting a slow-growing Summer tree in the Spring is smart, but maybe don't plant it in the middle of Summer!",
bookSeasons3,,,book,"Winter is the hardest season, since very few crops are GOOD in Winter, and many crops are BAD. Make sure you have a balanced inventory so you're never stuck in a season with only BAD crops!",

bookShop0,,,book,"There are various establishments that will gladly take your hard-earned cash in exchange for goods and services: inns and shops selling fixtures, seeds, and equipment.",
bookShop1,,,book,"Sleeping at an inn will recover all your health and give you some bonus health. If you lose in a battle, you will wake up at the last inn you stayed at. Inns also have various books with helpful information in them.",
bookShop2,,,book,"At shops you can buy various items: seeds and other crop starters (like eggs), equipment like sickles, compost bins, gloves, and watering cans, and farm fixtures like mushroom logs and egg incubators.",
bookShop3,,,book,"Some shops will also let you sell items back to them. Keep an eye out for shopkeepers with a ""talk"" option available, as they might also have useful information or a special request for you.",
bookEquip,,,bname,"""Equipment and Fixtures"" by E.E. Quippings \n Information on equipment for your body and fixtures for your farm.",
bookEquip0,,,book,"There are four types of equipment: weapons, compost bins, gloves, and watering cans. Weapons will affect your melee attack power (how much damage you do when you attack with no ripe crops available) and what types of targets you can attack.",
bookEquip1,,,book,A Compost Bin is needed to compost crops and recover health during battle. The type of bin you use can determine how many crops you can compost at once. Gloves increase your damage resistance and can let you perform multiple actions in one turn.,
bookEquip2,,,book,"Watering Cans will affect how your crops grow. Some will make your crops grow faster, others will make your crops more resistant to growing in off seasons, and others will multiply a crop's seasonal bonuses or weaknesses.",
bookEquip3,,,book,"Fixtures can be placed on your Field to allow you to grow different types of crops. Without any Fixtures, all you can grow are fruits and vegetables. If you place a Mushroom Log on your Field, however, you will be able to plant Mushroom Seeds on it.",
bookEquip4,,,book,"Other Fixtures, like Egg Incubators, Paddy Fields, and Season Modulators, all have different effects. You can put as many on your Field as you can fit on there, but make sure you have the right Seeds to go with your Fixtures! Standard veggie seeds can't be planted on Mushroom Logs!",

bookMush2,,,book,"Ripe mushrooms will remain on their logs until they are harvested. Mushroom Logs are, however, susceptible to fire, and if a Log is burned it will kill any mushrooms growing on it and will render the Log unusable for several turns.",

bookEgg1,,,book,"Once an egg hatches, it can be harvested like any other crop and the hatched animal can be thrown at enemies. Unlike vegetables, hatched eggs will not rot if they are unused, but their power will increase with every turn they are unused.",
bookEgg2,,,book,"The longer you leave a hatched egg on your field, the more damage it will do when finally used for an attack. Unlike most other crop types, eggs cannot be composted in any stage of their development no matter what kind of Compost Bin you have.",
bookEgg3,,,book,"Like Mushroom Logs, Incubators are resistant to most elemental attacks, but are can be burned by fire attacks, making them unusable for several turns.",
bookExpand,,,bname,"""Farm Expansions"" by Marge Fields \n Information on Farm Expansions and Upgrades.",
bookExpand0,,,book,"Some shops don't sell any items, but will increase the size of your Field in exchange for cash monies. Each Upgrade Shop will have more sizes available than the previous one.",
bookExpand1,,,book,"Initially your Field is only 3x3 tiles big, but it can be expanded to be much bigger than that. Later on, you will be able to choose between different upgrades, with some offering more tiles overall, while others offer more space to place larger Fixtures and Crops (like Trees).",
bookExpand2,,,book,"There are three tiers of upgrade after the initial 3x3 size. The first tier brings your field size to 4x4, and the following two tiers offer two different upgrade sizes each - but once you pick one, you can't switch to the other, so choose wisely!",
bookExpand3,,,book,"Be sure to upgrade your Field size as soon as you can afford to do so, as it will be much harder to defeat stronger enemies when your Field is tiny!",

bookForest1,,,book,"Compasses don't work in this forest, as if there were strong magnetic interference, and when walking down certain paths, people claim to feel as though they have been ""warped"" to another part of the forest entirely by supernatural forces.",
bookForest2,,,book,"The forest is home to wildlife like turkeys, mice, squirrels, and bears, as well as rare flora like golden mushrooms, so many adventurers decide to enter the forest despite the townsfolk's stories and warnings.",

bookPaddy1,,,book,"Paddy Crops grow just like regular Vegetables and do not regrow, but they do not rot, and a fresh Paddy Crop is much stronger than a Field Crop of the same Star Rating.",
bookPaddy2,,,book,"Paddy Crops will always inflict Recoil Damage, so attacks with Paddy Crops won't just hit your target, but will also hit all other enemies in the battle.",
bookRare,,,bname,"""Rare Crops"" by Dale McOneOfAKind \n A primer on rare and unique crops.",

bookFish0,,,book,"If a Lake Fixture is added to your field, you will be able to place fishing rods, nets, and spears in them. Each item behaves differently, but all of them will give you fish. Like eggs, fish do not rot and cannot be composted.",
bookFish1,,,book,"The main difference between Fish and most other types of crops is their randomness - there is no set time from when a Lake item is placed and when a fish is caught, but the power of the item increases the odds of catching a fish on any given turn.",
bookFish2,,,book,"When placed, Fishing Rods and Fishing Nets will both randomly catch a fish after some number of turns. If a Fishing Rod does not catch any fish after its specified number of turns, it will break down. Fishing nets, however, will not go away until they catch a fish.",
bookFish3,,,book,Fishing Spears will either catch a fish or fail to do so on the same turn they are used. Lake Fixtures and all of their crops are immune to all elemental attack types.,
bookBees,,,bname,"""Beekeeping 101"" by Honey Boy \n A beginner's guide to raising bees.",
bookBees0,,,book,"Unlike most other Fixtures, Beehives can't be found in stores. Beehives are on trees all around the world, and if you find one, it will give you a Beehive Fixture as well as some bees to put in it.",
bookBees1,,,book,"Once a Beehive Fixture is placed, bees can be placed in it. Bees will produce honey after a random number of turns, which can be used for attacking or composting. When attacking with honey, there is a chance the enemy will become stunned.",
bookBees2,,,book,"Composting honey recovers much more health than other crops with similar Star Ratings. When attacking with honey, the bees will continue producing more honey, but composting it will clear out the Beehive, so more bees will need to be placed inside.",
bookBees3,,,book,"Like Mushroom Logs and Incubators, Beehives are susceptible to fire-based attacks and can be made unusable for several turns by them. Bees are very sensitive, so please do not use pesticides when working with them!!",
bookCows,,,bname,"""Cows"" by Boh Vyn. \n What is cows? Read this book to find out!",
bookCows0,,,book,"Cows are large Fixtures that can be placed on your Field. During combat, you can feed cows various seeds and Animal Feed. After a cow has been fed, you can compost to get Milk from it.",
bookCows1,,,book,"Milk recovers much more health than composting standard crops. You can feed a cow multiple times, which will increase the recovery power of its Milk once it is composted. Once fed, the cow remain ready until it is milked or until the end of the battle.",
bookTech,,,bname,"""What's Technology?"" by Lil' Willy Fences \n The premiere resource on Technology Fixtures.",
bookTech0,,,book,"Technology is an amazing thing. In fact, it's probably the best thing. Technology is great. You can use technology on your Field to make it a better Field that is good and better than a Field that does not have technology on it.",
bookTech1,,,book,"Are you tired of waiting 30 turns for the season to change? Sick of being at the whim of your foes messing with the laws of nature? Mess right back! With a Season Modulator, you can make this season be ANY season!",
bookTech2,,,book,"Farming is the WORST. You have to plant seeds, then you have to wait for them to grow, then you have to throw them! Seeds are too tiny to throw! But with a Seed Shooter, you can load it up with seeds and then fire them at all of your foes IN JUST ONE TURN!",
bookTech3,,,book,"Sick of planting ""fruits"" and ""vegetables"" in your Field? Wish you could plant batteries and apps instead? Place a Hotspot on your Field and you'll be able to plant up to four hip tech devices on it!",

bookTechs,,,bname,"""What's Hotspot?"" by Lil' Stevey Duties \n The premiere resource on Hotspot Crops.",
bookTechs0,,,book,"Hotspot Fixtures allow you to place Technology on your Field. Tech items do not rot, grow perfectly in every season, and are significantly more powerful than other crops with similar Star Ratings.",
bookTechs1,,,book,"Tech items vary greatly in their usage. Some regrow after being harvested, some get more powerful as they stay on the field, they can be big or small, and some can even be composted. Their only weakness is water, which will fry an entire Hotspot and all items on it for several turns.",
bookTips,,,bname,"""Advanced Farming Tips"" by Skumpy \n A guide to growing crops for more experienced farmers.",
bookTips0,,,book,"If you've gotten this far, you've probably gotten the hang of timing your harvests so you can attack with a large number of crops at once. The more crops you harvest in one turn, the more damage you will do, and the chance of recoil hitting other enemies will be higher.",
bookTips1,,,book,"However, don't forget that with certain weapons, you can also target enemy crops in addition to the enemies themselves with your attacks. If you see that a very powerful crop has been planted, it might be wise to take it out before it's ripe to avoid being hit by it.",
bookTips2,,,book,"It's also a good idea to keep a variety of different Fixtures on your Field. Stronger enemies will target your crops and may have elemental powers, which affect each Fixture differently. You don't want to have a Field full of Mushroom Logs when fighting someone with fire attacks!",
bookTips3,,,book,"Don't forget to keep buying new equipment! Buy the right stuff that suits your playstyle so you can fight more effectively. Make sure you are on the top of your Compost game, because all the power in the world won't help you if you don't have any way of recovering health!",
bookCard,,,bname,"""The WACG Card Game"" by cardBoy240 \n A beginner's guide to the hottest new card game sweeping the nation.",
bookCard0,,,book,"""Wow! Another Card Game!"" or WACG for short, is a collectable card game adored by techies in hip cities like Las Abejas. Like many other CCGs, the goal of the game is to assemble a good deck and use your cards to defeat your opponent.",
bookCard1,,,book,"This is mostly accomplished by spending lots of money on booster packs to get cards that aren't worthless, but some strategy is involved in the gameplay itself. There are three types of cards: Character Cards, Element Cards, and Effect Cards.",
bookCard2,,,book,"A player must have one Character Card on their field to play the game - if they do not have a Character Card in their hand or on the field, they will have to discard a card from their hand and draw a new card until they have a Character Card in their hand to place on the field.",
bookCard3,,,book,"Character Cards can be in Attack or Defense positions. When in the Attack Position, the player will do more damage when attacking, but be more vulnerable to attacks themselves. Likewise, when in the Defense Position, the player will take less damage when attacked.",
bookCard4,,,book,"Up to two Element Cards can be placed on the player's field at once. When in play, Element Cards affect the types of attack the player can perform. For example, with a Fire Element Card in play, a player's attacks will also inflict burn damage.",
bookCard5,,,book,"Up to three Effect Cards can be placed on the player's field. Each Effect Card has a different effect that lasts as long as the card is in play. For example, the ""Gobulin Shield"" card increases the player's defense and ""The Blue Winter"" ensures that it is always Winter.",
bookCard6,,,book,"Now that you've read this guide, you should have the knowledge to make fun of nerds playing this game in more detail than you would have previously! Have fun!",

bookMan0,,,book,"When the very first human thought ""me hungry, me want food,"" it was already clear that we had failed as a species. To be ruled by such primal instincts like hunger puts us on the same tier as animals: the worthless tier.",
bookMan1,,,book,"But as mankind evolved, so too have our methods of solving the hunger issue. Food used to come from hunting and farming, but now we have reached a point where we can order food on our smartphones. An improvement, but not improvement enough.",
bookMan2,,,book,"Much has been done to speed up the process of acquiring food, but the task of eating it remains as wasteful and time consuming as ever. And don't get me started on COOKING. Who has time to put frozen waffles in a toaster and wait two minutes in THIS economy??",
bookMan3,,,book,"At Food2, we know we can do better, because we ARE better. I have a degree! When our founder saw people leaving work in the afternoon to ""eat"" ""lunch"" at his old job, he knew there was a problem that needed to be solved.",
bookMan4,,,book,"His solution? Food2: a proprietary meal replacement beverage that requires no preparation, no refrigeration, no need to leave the cubicle! Just shake, open, and drink! And yes, we are working very hard on getting rid of those ""shake"" and ""open"" steps.",

*,,,,Sleeping at an Inn,
innSleep,,,sleep,A good night's sleep is exactly what I needed...,
innDream0,,,sleep,"An eight-legged goose flies up and lands in front of me. ""Christmas is coming,"" he says. ""Did you get your sister a gift?"" I shake my head, I had completely forgotten. ""You're the reason Santa died,"" growls the goose, before it blows away like a piece of paper.",
innDream1,,,sleep,"I'm floating in a bright pink void. There is nothing around me for miles. All I can feel is the distinct taste of olive oil on my tongue. Suddenly I begin to feel myself falling. A voice in the distance screams my name. Right before I hit the ground, I wake up.",
innDream2,,,sleep,"Several religious figures and deities tower over me. They are talking amongst themselves. ""I'd let her into my afterlife,"" one says, ""she's good in my book."" Another chimes in ""I'd reincarnate her into a cow. See how much she likes dairy after THAT."" The others nod. ""I like that, maybe my religion needs reincarnation"" one mutters. ""I think her heart's in the right place. She's no saint, but I'd let her into my heaven,"" says another. ""Yeah but she said a bad word once,"" replies the deity next to them. ""Oh, she did? Nevermind, she's doomed.""",
innDream3,,,sleep,"A cat is standing on top of me, staring me in the eyes. ""Feed me,"" it says. ""Okay,"" I reply, ""but I can't get up until you get off of me."" The cat does not acknowledge my response. It continues, ""I want some lasagna."" I try to get up, but its weight keeps me pinned down. We both starve.",
innDream4,,,sleep,"I try to pull a carrot out of the ground, but it's stuck. I keep pulling and it still won't budge. I put all of my strength into it and finally pull the vegetable out of the ground, but attached to the stalk is not a carrot, but my father. ""Are you getting enough Vitamin B?"" he asks.",
innDream5,,,sleep,Two cats are fighting outside my window. Their meows sound like whip cracks and their hisses sound like the opening theme to a sitcom I used to watch as a child. I open my window and shout at them to leave and they immediately sink into the ground and vanish.,
innDream6,,,sleep,"I open my chicken coop to collect eggs. As I pick one up, it begins to vibrate and crack. A tiny opossum head pops out of it. ""I ate the egg, then I became the egg,"" it says, ""and now you are my mother."" I put it back down and leave the coop, but I can still hear it calling for its mama.",
innDream7,,,sleep,"I lower my body into the hot spring. After a long day of farming, this is exactly what I needed. The sound of crickets chirping in the distance is the perfect background noise. Suddenly the water turns black. A voice says ""sorry."" I turn to see an octopus next to me. ""I farted.""",
innDream8,,,sleep,"It is Sunday, and my mom wakes me up to go to church. ""I don't wanna,"" I grumble as I roll over in my bed. ""Now now, if we don't go to church, the neighbors will kill us!"" my mom says. I turn around to face her. ""Wait, what?"" The neighbors have a gun to her head. ""Please honey, let's go to church.""",
innDream9,,,sleep,"I lower my body into the hot spring. After a long day of farming, this is exactly what I needed. The sound of crickets chirping in the distance is the perfect background noise. Suddenly the water turns black. A voice says sorry. I turn to see an octopus next to me. I farted.",

underground1,,skyler,text,Skyler: Here's how it works: you jump down this hole and land in a magical cave full of terrifying foes and valuable treasure that's yours for the taking!,
underground2,,skyler,text,"Skyler: The deeper you go, the stronger the foes and the more valuable the treasure! And best of all, going down the cave is absolutely free!",
underground3,,skyler,text,"Skyler: What's the catch, you ask? Why, there's no catch!",
underground4,,skyler,text,"Skyler: But here's the catch: normally after you win a battle, you recover all your health. That doesn't happen down there.",
underground5,,skyler,text,"Skyler: The only ways to recover health down there are by leveling up, healing in combat with composting techniques, or finding and using special Healing Stations.",
underground6,,skyler,text,"Skyler: You can bail out at any time - just tug on the Exit Rope and we'll pull you back up here again, safe and sound!",
underground7,,skyler,text,"Skyler: But if you die in the cave... you die in real life. You can't run from battles, and if you lose, we have to come down and save you.",
underground8,,skyler,text,"Skyler: And that's how we make our money! Cavediving is free, but we charge a very steep Recovery Fee if you lose a battle.",
underground9,,skyler,text,"Skyler: How much, you ask? 5000G! But even if you don't have that on you, we're not just going to leave you down there to die, that's messed up, even for us!",
underground10,,skyler,text,"Skyler: But just between you and me, I've definitely heard some rumors and accusations about our Recovery Response Team.",
underground11,,skyler,text,"Skyler: Lots of cavedivers have reported that, after they were recovered, they were missing a lot more than just 5000G. Extra money and items were gone!",
underground12,,skyler,text,"Skyler: They insist that the Recovery Response Team is looting their unconscious bodies, but the RRT insists that some of the monsters down there just like looting!",
underground13,,skyler,text,"Skyler: The cavedivers don't have any evidence that the RRT is actually responsible for the looting, so no successful lawsuits have gone through or anything.",
underground14,,skyler,text,"Skyler: Still, if you're low in health or fighting foes that are too strong for you, it's probably best to just go tug on that Exit Rope.",
underground15,,skyler,text,"Skyler: Also, you can't save your game in the cave. If you do, you'll be back up here when you load that save file. It's a nonstop cavediving adventure with no brakes!",

					<h1 class="text-center">Uprooted: Meal Replacement Game</h1>
					<h2 class="text-center mb-4">Instruction Manual and Informational Guide</h2>
					<a name="top" class="h3">Introduction</a>
					<p>
						You are <strong>Ayana</strong>, a farmer living in <strong>San Ambrosio, CA</strong>, and you're having a very busy day. 
						First, a city boy named <strong>Nathan</strong> came to your farm offering to work as an intern, and after that, some nerd 
						who called himself <strong>Beckett</strong> told you he didn't want you farming anymore, since your food would compete with 
						his fancy new meal replacement drink - <strong>Food2</strong>. And now there are robots everywhere! Looks like you're in 
						for quite a busy day.
					</p>
					<p>
						The "Manual" half of this document will be spoiler-free. The "Guide" section will have mild spoilers, with major spoilers 
						being hidden behind Spoiler Warnings that must be clicked to reveal.
					</p>

					<a name="controls" class="h3">Controls</a>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Player/Menu Movement: </strong> Arrow Keys (Keyboard), Left Analog Stick or Directional Pad (Gamepad)</li>
						<li><strong>Interact, Confirm: </strong> Z (Keyboard), A Button (Gamepad)</li>
						<li><strong>Cancel, Go Back: </strong> X (Keyboard), B Button (Gamepad)</li>
						<li><strong>Run (World Map): </strong> Hold Cancel Key/Button, then Release</li>
						<li><strong>Pause Menu: </strong> Enter (Keyboard), Start Button (Gamepad)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>All controls can be changed at any time in the <a class="reflink" href="#options">Options Menu</a>.</p>

					<a name="how" class="h3">How to Play</a>
					<div class="h4">Getting Started</div>
					<p>
						On the <strong>Title Screen</strong>, select <strong>New Game</strong> to start a new game - if you already have a save
						file you can select the <strong>Continue</strong> option to load an existing save. When starting a new game, you will 
						first be asked if you're okay with seeing strong language. Make your selection with the <strong>Menu Movement</strong>
						controls, then press <strong>Confirm</strong> to confirm your selection. Once the game has started, you can use the 
						controls described above to navigate the game world and menus.
					</p>
					<a name="gameworld" class="h4">Basic Gameplay</a>
					<p>
						There are many places to go and people - both friends and foes - to talk to in the world of Uprooted. To interact with
						something, walk up to it and press <strong>Interact</strong>. If you would like to enter a building or shop, just walk 
						into it. When talking to people, they may ask you for help, give you items, or - if they suck - fight you.
					</p>
					<a name="combat" class="h4">Combat</a>
					<p>
						Once a battle starts, you'll generally have four options - <strong>Plant</strong>, <strong>Attack</strong>, 
						<strong>Compost</strong>, and <strong>Run</strong>. In some cases you won't be able to plant or run, so you'll have a
						<strong>Pass</strong> option in their place to skip your turn.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Plant</strong> allows you to plant some seeds in your <strong>field</strong>. Depending on your equipment, you 
						can plant one or more seeds on a given turn. In addition to <strong>fruit</strong> and <strong>vegetable</strong> seeds,
						if you have the right <strong>fixtures</strong> on your <strong>field</strong>, you can place other items like 
						<strong>eggs</strong> and <strong>mushrooms</strong>. Everything you place on your field will require a different amount
						of time to grow and become <strong>ready</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Attack</strong> allows you to attack your enemies with a melee weapon, or - if you have one or more <strong>ready</strong>
						crops on your <strong>field</strong>, throw all of them at your enemies. The more crops you throw at once, the more damage 
						you'll do (throwing 2 crops in one turn does more damage than throwing those same two crops in separate turns), and with 
						every consecutive turn you throw crops, you'll do more damage, too! With certain <strong>equipment</strong>, you can even
						<strong>plant</strong> and <strong>attack</strong> in the same turn! 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have a <strong>compost bin</strong> equipped, you can <strong>Compost</strong> one or more of your crops to recover 
						health. The type of <strong>compost bin</strong> you have determines what kinds of crops you can compost and how many you can
						select per turn. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you don't want to engage in a fight, you can try to <strong>Run</strong>. Running is not always successful, and if you
						fail you'll fall on your face and have to wait until your next turn to fight back or try running again. You cannot run away 
						from boss battles.
					</p>
					<a name="pause" class="h4">Pause Menu</a>
					<p>
						The <strong>Inventory</strong> section will let you view all of the seeds and crops you have.
						There are 10 different types of crops:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>Standard crops that grow and get thrown when ripe. If you don't throw them when they're <strong>ready</strong>, they'll rot.</li>
							<li><strong>Trees: </strong>Trees usually take longer to grow, but after you throw their <strong>ready</strong> fruit, the fruits will grow back. If you don't throw the <strong>ready</strong> fruit, they'll restart their growing cycle.</li>
							<li><strong>Mushrooms: </strong>Mushroom seeds can only be planted on <strong>mushroom logs</strong>, and they grow back just like fruits do.</li>
							<li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Eggs can only be placed on <strong>coops</strong>. Once they hatch, they will not rot, and the longer you keep them on your <strong>field</strong>, the more damage they'll do when you finally attack with them. You cannot <strong>compost</strong> eggs.</li>
							<li><strong>Bees: </strong>Bees can only be placed in <strong>beehives</strong>. They take a random amount of time to become <strong>ready</strong>, and when they do they can be composted for extra health, or used in an attack that might temporarily stun your enemies.</li>
							<li><strong>Rice: </strong>Rice can only be planted in <strong>paddies</strong>. They behave like <strong>vegetables</strong>, but are more likely to cause recoil and damage more enemies at once.</li>
							<li><strong>Animal Feed: </strong>Animal feed can be fed to <strong>cows</strong>. A well-fed cow can be milked with the <strong>compost</strong> action to recover large amounts of health.</li>
							<li><strong>Fishing Supplies: </strong>Fishing supplies can be used in <strong>bodies of water</strong>. Fishing supplies have a random chance of catching fish each turn. Once caught, the supply becomes <strong>ready</strong> and can be attacked with. You cannot <strong>compost</strong> fish.</li>
							<li><strong>Technology: </strong>Technology can only be placed on <strong>HotSpots</strong>. Technology items have various unique behaviors in combat.</li>
							<li><strong>Water: </strong>Water can be used to manually speed up the growth of specific crops.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>Equipment</strong> section will let you manage what items you have equipped. <strong>Sickles</strong> determine your 
						attack power, who you can attack, and how you attack. <strong>Gloves</strong> boost your defense and can allow you to plant more 
						seeds per turn. <strong>Compost Bins</strong> determine what you can compost and how much of it, as well as how much health you'll
						recover through composting. <strong>Watering Cans</strong> control the growth speed and health of your crops.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>Fixtures</strong> section allows you to place various fixtures on your <strong>field</strong>. You can find 
						more fixtures in stores and by helping people, and you can expand your <strong>field</strong> at <strong>Expansion Shops</strong>
						across the world, giving you more space to plant fixtures and seeds.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <a class="reflink" href="#options">Options Menu</a> will allow you to change various settings, described below in a separate section. You can
						view your progress on the <strong>Achievements</strong> screen. In the upper-right corner is the <a class="reflink" href="#nofun">I'm Not Having Fun Menu</a>.
					<p>
						You can save your game at any time with the <strong>Save Menu</strong>. There are 10 save slots to choose from, plus
						one <strong>Auto-Save</strong> option that is created every time you sleep at an <strong>Inn</strong>.
					</p>
					<a name="options" class="h4">Options</a>
					<p>The following options are available for you to customize at any time before or during your game:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Difficulty: </strong>The game's difficulty. As difficulty increases, items cost more, drop less frequently in combat, and enemies do more damage.</li>
						<li><strong>Font: </strong>Choose from the standard pixelated font, or <strong>OpenDyslexic</strong>, an accessible font that may help with reading.</li>
						<li><strong>Font Size: </strong>Set the size of in-game fonts.</li>
						<li><strong>Gameplay: </strong>This game doesn't have any.</li>
						<li><strong>Strong Language: </strong>Determines whether characters say "darn" or "damn," and so on.</li>
						<li><strong>Sticky Movement: </strong>When turned on, you only need to press a movement button once to start move in that direction, then press it again to stop.</li>
						<li><strong>Ignore Mouse: </strong>If set, mouse controls will be disabled and the cursor will be hidden while playing.</li>
						<li><strong>Control Type: </strong>You can use either a keyboard or gamepad to play. If you press a button on the gamepad or key on the keyboard, the control type will switch automatically.</li>
						<li><strong>Analog Deadzone: </strong>(Gamepad Only) Control the deadzone - or how much you have to tilt it in one direction for it to register as being pressed - of your analog sticks.</li>
						<li><strong>Movement Controls: </strong>(Gamepad Only) Choose whether you wish to use the standard analog stick/directional pad controls for movement, or if you want to specify your own controls.</li>
						<li><strong>Controls: </strong>Configure your controls. Press <strong>Confirm</strong> to choose an action, then press any key or button to assign it. Press <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel this assignment.</li>
						<li><strong>Audio: </strong>Set the relative volume of music and sound effects.</li>
						<li><strong>Graphics: </strong>Set the screen resolution and whether or not to use the full screen.</li>
						<li><strong>Filter: </strong>Choose an optional graphic filter to change how the game looks.</li>
					</ul>
					<a name="nofun" class="h4">The "I'm Not Having Fun" Menu</a>
					<p>If at any point you're frustrated with the game, check out the "I'm Not Having Fun" menu at any time for various options that might be able to help with no penalties.
						You can raise or lower the game's difficulty, have puzzles solved for you, receive a recap of the game's story, view tutorials, get items and stat boosts, and more!</p>
